Nikhil Patel - ENGR101 - Testing log


Logs:

Core testing:

12th June - 12:30:   
Tested the code for the core, it seems as though the robot gets close to the finish line and then goes off track.
Other than that no further suggestions for the core, it seems to follow the line quite well.

13th June - 10:53:

 Suggestion:
In order for the robot to reach the finish line, make the code detect if a certain amount of the pixels are black (As the finish line is a black “finish” flag), then the robot will stop, i.e. set the speed of the robot to 0.

16th June - 6:50:

The robot seems to stop at the finish line now, therefore now the core is fine.

Completion testing:

    13th June 10:58:

Tested code for completion and seems to work as intended. However has the same issue as the core where the robot gets close to the finish line and goes off track.

    18th June - 1:16:

With the current code being worked on for the challenge, it seems to go off track. And when it does, the robot seems to be programmed to turn right when it cannot find a white pixel.
As it’s turning it reads the white pixels of the duck image and turns towards that direction, and stops when it touches the duck image.


    16th June - 6:53:

The code currently is being worked on for the challenge however the current code does not seem to make the robot follow the line the track. This may be resolved if the current challenge component of the code is removed, or when the code starts working for challenge as well.

Challenge testing:

    16th June - 6:59:

For the challenge the robot seems to stop about halfway through the course, when trying to make a sharp corner.  

I would think that the reason the robot would stop is due to the vLeft and vRight values get set to 0 at that point in the track. Will possibly need a further look into the code to provide suggestions to solve this.

    18th June - 1:15:

Still seems to have the same issues from previous tests.
